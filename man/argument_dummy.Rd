of the plot.}

\item{whole_sample}{Logical. If TRUE, normalization of the values used
takes place in the light of the complete sample.}

\item{x_nth}{Numeric value. If the number of breaks/labels on the

third label is kept. And so on.}

\item{xrange, yrange}{\link[=concept_distance_measure]{Distance vector} of length
two or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL}, specifies the x- and y-range to which
the spatial output is cropped. E.g. \code{xrange = c(200, 500)} results in
